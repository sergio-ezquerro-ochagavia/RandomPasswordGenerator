  -times TIMES    number of passwords to generate
  -length LENGTH  length of passwords to generate

  -u              include uppercase characters
  -l              include lowercase characters
  -n              include numbers
  -x              include symbols

output:
  -p              print the generated passwords
  -s              save generated passwords in file
  -o              overwrite file
  -file FILE      path of file to generate
  -v, --verbose   deeper logging information

Valid examples:

> Generate 5 passwords with 20 characters each, using uppercase, lowercase and number characters, and print them as output       
    py RandPwGen.py -times 5 -length 20 -puln
> Generate 10 passwords with 16 characters each, using uppercase, lowercase, number and symbol characters, and save them to the default file "pwds.txt"
    py RandPwGen.py -times 10 -length 16 -s
> Generate 1 password with 16 characters, and save it to "passwords.txt", overriding whatever was in it in the case it existed before
    py RandPwGen.py -file "passwords.txt" -so

As an alternative to the commandline, params can be placed in a file, one per line, and specified on the commandline like "RandPwGen.py '@params.conf'".
    Example: py RandPwGen.py '@params.conf'
